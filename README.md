# Insurance Claims Risk Analysis using Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes insurance claims data to identify **risk concentration**, **customer demographic patterns**, and **cost drivers** that contribute to high claim severity.  
The goal is to support **risk assessment, pricing decisions, and fraud awareness** using interactive Tableau dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer demographics associated with higher claim risk  
- Identify regions and segments driving maximum claim costs  
- Analyze claim frequency vs claim severity  
- Highlight patterns that can inform underwriting and risk mitigation

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – data visualization & dashboarding  
- **Excel / CSV** – data preparation  
- **SQL** – data extraction and preprocessing  
- **GitHub** – project documentation and version control

## 📊 Dashboards Included

### 1️⃣ Customer Demographics / User Profile
This dashboard focuses on how customer attributes influence insurance claim behavior.

🔗 **Live Dashboard (Tableau Public):**  
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kanimozhi.s5156/viz/InsuranceClaimsRiskAnalysisusingTableau-KanimozhiS/CustomerDemographicsUserProfile

**Insights covered:**
- Claim distribution across age groups and gender  
- High-risk customer segments  
- Relationship between demographics and claim severity  

*(Interactive filters allow drill-down by customer attributes)*

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A **small subset of customer segments** contributes to a disproportionately high share of claim costs  
- Certain demographic groups show **lower frequency but higher severity** claims  
- Risk is not evenly distributed — it clusters by **customer profile and region**
